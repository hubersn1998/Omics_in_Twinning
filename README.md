# Omics_in_Twinning
This Github repository includes all the scripts that were used in the project by Hubers et al (2024) that can be found at the preprint servire MedRxiv at :https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.25.24309452

This repository contains two parts:
1. Transcriptomics: A. Transcriptomics_Twinning_Analyses.R: one script to perform regression analysis on RNA probes for zygosity status. B. Transcriptomics_Twinning_Enrichtments.R: script to perform enrichment analyses
2. Metabolomics: A. Metabolomics_Twinning_PerCohort_Analyses.R: one script to perform regression analyses for metabolite levels for zygosity for one cohort. B. Metabolomics_Twinning_AnalysisFunctions.R: script that holds the analysis fucntions that is required for Metabolomics_Twinning_PerCohort_Analyses.R. C. Metabolomics_Twinning_MA.R: script on to perform meta-analyses of the metabolites levels and zygosity.
