# Omics_in_Twinning
This Github repository includes all the scripts that were used in the project that can be found ...

This repository contains two parts:
1. Transcriptomics: one script to perform regression analysis on RNA probes for zygosity status and a script to perform enrichment analyses
2. Metabolomics: one script to perform regression analyses for metabolite levels for zygosity, one script that holds the actual analysis code, required for the regression script and one script on to perform meta-analyses to combine multiple metabolomic datasets.
